Originally written as support code for the blog post named [Android Databinding: Goodbye Presenter, Hello Viewmodel!](http://tech.vg.no/2015/07/17/android-databinding-goodbye-presenter-hello-viewmodel/).

See tags [mvp](507d81a25f6eca18760d52e5fcbf88b27b1942ea) and [mvvm](115d3946a2a6b4c372f34f21c6cadd3a41d7e503) referred to by that post.

Later expanded upon to include a more complete Databinding example with full two-way databinding of EditText-fields at the 
[two-way-implicit](9c95ec98802612b191ebdb433909b50dc429f911) tag,
or manual read-back if you prefer that by the [two-way-explicit](6b6848a0506529fb1615143a7323cc83957f2a3e) tag.
